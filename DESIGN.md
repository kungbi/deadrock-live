## Overview

This concert uses terminal language as information architecture, not as a neon green-screen skin. The concert remains readable first; terminal treatment is reserved for labels, logs, and section structure.

## Colors

- **Lime `#B8FF72`:** only interactive/selected states and SQL emphasis.
- **Orange-red `#FF5B35`:** only errors and the crossed-out `L` in the DEADROCK logo.
- **YouTube red `#FF3B30`:** YouTube mark only.
- **Neutral surfaces:** use only canvas, base, and surface levels. Do not add component-specific dark greens.
- **Typography:** use primary and secondary tokens only. Do not use purple or decorative orange labels.

## Typography

Pretendard is the sole display and Korean-information family: titles, event details, cards, and buttons all use it. JetBrains Mono is only for terminal syntax: SQL/logs, command prefixes, labels, metadata, and tab controls. Korean glyphs in a terminal string fall back to Pretendard.

## Layout

Use 18px side padding for primary sections and full-width 1px borders for transcript/table rows. Preserve breathing room between sections; do not create rounded card collections.

## Shapes

TUI elements use square corners. Borders are 1px `border`.

## Components

- Selected tab, open-state control, and main CTA use lime with dark text.
- Error output uses orange-red text on a dark surface.
- Every normal row uses the shared surface and border values.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do keep accent color role-based.
- Do keep YouTube red isolated to its brand icon.
- Don't use purple session labels.
- Don't use orange for ordinary labels, hints, dates, or metadata.
- Don't introduce a new literal color in a component; add a token first.
