A one-page live-event guide styled as a MySQL terminal that has found its rhythm in a deadlock.

## Project structure

```text

├── index.html          # page structure and public event facts
├── deadrock.css        # terminal visual system and responsive layout
├── deadrock.js         # timetable, setlist, interaction rendering

## Editing event information

Use [`event-data.js`](./event-data.js) for timetable, acts, songs, credits, and notices. Keep public facts in `index.html` when they are part of the fixed event shell: date, venue, map link, and the compact action dock.

## Design notes

- **Event facts lead.** Korean event information uses Pretendard for readable mobile scanning.
- **Terminal syntax supports.** `mysql>` and `$ cat ~/…` are atmosphere, not primary information.
- **DEADROCK stays loud.** Lime is reserved for system/status accents; orange-red is reserved for the deadlock error and active navigation state.
- **Small-screen first.** The desktop canvas preserves a centered mobile-readable event guide.
